# Fraudulent-Claim-on-Cars-Physical-Damage
 A Fraud Car Claim Detection Model was developed using a dataset from Kaggle. DBSCAN was applied for multivariate outlier detection, and PCA, MCA, and FAMD were utilized for dimensionality reduction. Multicollinearity among numerical and categorical variables was identified using Pearson’s correlation and Cramer's V, with visualization achieved through heatmaps. Various algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and ANN, were experimented with. Class imbalance was addressed through the application of SMOTE, upsampling, and downsampling. The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, F1 score, and recall, with Gradient Boost identified as the optimal performer.A Fraud Car Claim Detection Model was developed using a dataset from Kaggle.
