# Fraudulent-Claim-on-Cars-Physical-Damage
 An in-depth analysis of car insurance claims from the USA was conducted, aimed at identifying fraudulent activities through advanced data analytics and machine learning models. The project focused on uncovering patterns and trends in car insurance fraud to mitigate financial risks for insurance companies. Python, R, were utilized to carry out the analysis on a dataset containing 17,998 claims sourced from Kaggle.
# Key highlights include :

    Data Preprocessing: Missing values were addressed, and one-hot encoding was applied to categorical variables.

    Handling Class Imbalance: Techniques as SMOTE, upsampling, and downsampling were employed to address class imbalance.

    Outlier Detection: DBSCAN was applied for multivariate outlier detection.

    Exploratory Data Analysis: Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify significant features contributing to fraudulent claims,

    Multicollinearity & Dimensionality Reduction: Strong correlations between variables were identified using Pearson’s correlation and Cramér’s V. Dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), and Factor Analysis for Mixed Data (FAMD) were applied.

    Cluster Analysis: The dataset’s structure was explored through the use of K-means, K-medoids, and K-prototype clustering algorithms.

    Model Evaluation: The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and F1 score.

    Machine Learning Models: Several algorithms, including Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting, were experimented with for fraud detection. Gradient Boosting emerged as the top-performing model, achieving an accuracy of 84.6%, a precision of 73.2%, and an F1 score of 48.5%.

    Feature Importance: Key features contributing to fraud detection were evaluated, and the model was refined using the top 20 variables, maintaining performance while streamlining the approach.An in-depth analysis of car insurance claims from the USA was conducted, aimed at identifying fraudulent activities through advanced data analytics and machine learning models.
