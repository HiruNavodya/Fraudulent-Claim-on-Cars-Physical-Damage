# Fraudulent-Claim-on-Cars-Physical-Damage
 A Fraud Car Claim Detection Model was developed using a dataset from Kaggle. DBSCAN was employed for multivariate outlier detection, and dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, MCA, and FAMD were applied. Multicollinearity among numerical and categorical variables was identified using Pearson’s correlation and Cramer's V, with results visualized through heatmaps.Cluster analysis was implemented using K-means, K-medoids, and K-prototype to explore the dataset's structure further. Various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and ANN, were experimented with. Class imbalance was addressed using SMOTE, upsampling, and downsampling techniques.Several evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, F1 score, and recall, were used to assess model performance. Gradient Boosting, without hyperparameter tuning, emerged as the optimal model on the original dataset, achieving the highest accuracy, precision, and F1 score.Skills:Python (Programming Language) · Machine Learning · Deep Learning · R (Programming Language) · Statistical Data Analysis · Data Visualization · Clustering
